# Commerce Agent Protocol (CAP) Specification

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft--01-orange)](docs/specification.md)

The **Commerce Agent Protocol (CAP)** is an open standard that enables personal AI agents to seamlessly discover and interact with compliant merchants for complete e-commerce purchase flows. CAP builds on the [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/) to provide standardized operations, data structures, and interaction guidelines specifically for AI-driven commerce.

## What CAP Enables

- **Standardized E-commerce Operations**: Product search, cart management, checkout flows
- **Merchant Discovery**: Consistent mechanism for AI agents to find CAP-compliant merchants
- **Interoperability**: Common language allowing any compliant agent to work with any compliant merchant
- **Open Ecosystem**: Level playing field enhancing consumer choice and merchant accessibility
