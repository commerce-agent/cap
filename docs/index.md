# Commerce Agent Protocol

<img src="./assets/cap-banner.jpg" width="100%" class="banner">

## Standardizing AI Agent Interactions for E-commerce

The **Commerce Agent Protocol (CAP)** is an open standard designed to enable personal AI agents to seamlessly discover and interact with compliant merchants for a complete e-commerce purchase flow. By defining a common language and a set of standardized operations, CAP aims to create an open, interoperable ecosystem for AI-driven commerce.

### Why CAP? The Future of AI-Powered Shopping

CAP empowers AI agents to become capable shopping assistants by addressing key challenges in AI-driven commerce:

- :material-store-search-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Simplified Merchant Discovery**

    Provides a consistent mechanism for AI agents to find CAP-compliant merchants and understand their e-commerce capabilities through standardized Agent Cards.

- :material-swap-horizontal-bold:{ .lg .middle } **Interoperable E-commerce Operations**

    Defines a clear set of standardized e-commerce operations (e.g., product search, cart management, checkout) with consistent data structures, enabling agents to interact with any compliant merchant reliably.

- :material-puzzle-edit-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Streamlined Agent Integration**

    Lowers the complexity for AI agent developers to integrate e-commerce functionalities by abstracting merchant-specific intricacies behind a uniform set of CAP-defined tasks.

- :material-account-group-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Open Commercial Ecosystem**

    Fosters a level playing field, enhancing consumer choice by making it easier for AI agents to connect with a diverse range of merchants through an open protocol.

### Built on Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol

CAP is a specialization of the [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/).

![CAP builds on A2A Graphic](./assets/cap-on-a2a.png)
{ .cap-on-a2a }


It leverages A2A's core framework for:

*   Agent discovery (via Agent Cards)
*   Task management
*   Secure communication (JSON-RPC over HTTPS)

CAP then focuses on defining the e-commerce-specific aspects: standardized operations, data structures for commerce, merchant and product discoverability, specific capability declarations, and interaction guidelines.
